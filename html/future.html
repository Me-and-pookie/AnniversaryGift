Or maybe walking barefoot along a quiet beach, feeling the sand between our toes while the waves crash around us. I can picture us hiking through peaceful trails, with nothing but nature around, and then catching the sunset from a mountaintop, just enjoying the moment together as the world lights up. I'm so excited for all the simple, unforgettable moments we'll share. There are many other moments like this i have in mind for us</p>
